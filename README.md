### Hi there, nice to see you here ✌🏻

Welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Andi Kratzel and I'm a passionate Frontend Developer from 🇩🇪 **Munich, Germany**, currently living in 🇩🇪 **Trier, Germany**.

Well, as you can see, my public Github profile is kinda empty and pretty much vacuous. There are reasons for that, though:

- I'm mostly working for clients with NDAs 📖 ❌
- I tend not to share my *private* projects, since they are ... well ... ***private*** 🚷
- I love coding, but coding is my *job* and beyond loving what I do, I like to spend my time *offline* - so please bare with me here 🏋🏻‍♂️

## How to reach me
I'm more than happy to connect with you either on my ...

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message if you're interested in working with me or if you simply want to have an easy conversation about anything you can imagine!
